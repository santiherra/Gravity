# Gravity
Repository dedicated to the study of the motion of bodies under the Newtonian gravitational interaction.

## Usage 
In order to use this project, clone the repository by copying the associated URL. Make sure you have installed the required packages with the proper versions: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
You will find some scripts, each of which generates an animation. So far, no more effort than clicking on `Run`, but feel free to change some of the parameters and initial conditions. Have fun! 

## Contents
* `solar_system.py`: python script dedicated to the computation of a particle orbit with a root finding method in the two body approximation. Application to the orbits of planets in the SS.
* `three_body.py`: python script dedicated to the numerical integration of the motion of three gravitationally-interacting particles.

More content and some great updates are yet to come... Keep track!
